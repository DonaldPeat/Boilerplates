# Scatter Boilerplates

This repository hosts example projects that can be used as either starting points or references 
to working with various plugins, and SDKs. It will be added to gradually as more and more 
SDKs/plugins surface.

The directories match the SDKs, and clicking on a directory will lead to it's own README.
